# Objective
This project focuses on cryptocurrency price forecasting using Time Series Foundation Models. It involves comparing open-source foundational models such as Chronos, TimesFM, Moirai, and Tiny Time Mixers with benchmark models like ARIMA and GRU as suggested in the related works.
The study will explore financial and machine learning-based evaluation metrics and analyze the impact of indexation on forecasting performance.
The aim of this project is to contribute to the advancement of time series forecasting in the volatile domain of cryptocurrency markets by leveraging innovative foundational models and benchmarking their effectiveness against established forecasting techniques.
